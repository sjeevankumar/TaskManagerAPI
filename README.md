Certainly! A Task Manager API is a backend system that allows users to manage tasks and to-do lists. Here are more details and features you can include in a Task Manager API:

User Authentication:

Implement user registration and login functionality to secure user-specific task data.
Use token-based authentication (JWT) to manage user sessions.
Task CRUD Operations:

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
Users should be able to add new tasks, view a list of tasks, update task details, and mark tasks as completed.
Task Categories:

Allow users to categorize tasks into different categories (e.g., work, personal, shopping).
Implement CRUD operations for task categories.
Priority Levels:

Add support for assigning priority levels to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
Users should be able to filter tasks based on priority.
Due Dates and Reminders:

Enable users to set due dates for tasks.
Implement a reminder system to notify users about upcoming deadlines.
Task Dependencies:

Allow tasks to have dependencies on other tasks.
Implement features to link tasks together and track dependencies.
Search and Filter:

Provide search functionality to allow users to find specific tasks.
Implement filters based on criteria like category, priority, and due date.
Collaboration:

Enable collaboration by allowing users to share tasks or task lists with other users.
Implement permission levels to control access to shared tasks.
History and Logging:

Maintain a history of task changes (creation, updates, deletions).
Implement a logging system to track user activities.
User Profile:

Allow users to view and edit their profiles.
Include features like changing passwords and updating user information.
Statistics and Analytics:

Provide users with insights into their task management, such as completed tasks over time, most frequently used categories, etc.
Notification System:

Implement a notification system to alert users about task updates, reminders, and other relevant information.
Security:

Ensure secure data storage and transmission.
Implement proper input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.
Documentation:

Create clear and comprehensive API documentation to guide developers on how to use the API.
Testing:

Implement unit tests and integration tests to ensure the reliability of the API.
By incorporating these features, you can create a robust Task Manager API that provides a comprehensive solution for users to organize and manage their tasks effectively.
